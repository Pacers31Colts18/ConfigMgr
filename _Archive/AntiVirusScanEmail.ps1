	.SYNOPSIS
		EndPoint Virus Scan
	
	.DESCRIPTION
		This script will initiate a full or quick scan, whichever switch is selected at the command line. Once the scan is completed, it will check the event viewer logs for a scan completed entry to verify the scan successfully completed. If the Email switch is designated at the command line, then an email is sent to the specified recipient. It is suggested the $EmailRecipient, $EmailSender, and $SMTPServer be predefined in the parameter field. I have also included a trigger of the application deployment evaluation cycle to expedite the process.
	
	.PARAMETER FullScan
		Initiate a full system scan
	
	.PARAMETER QuickScan
		Initiate a quick scan
	
	.PARAMETER Email
		Select if you want an email report sent to the specified email address
	
	.PARAMETER EmailRecipient
		Receipient's email address
	
	.PARAMETER EmailSender
		Sender's email address
	
	.PARAMETER SMTPServer
		SMTP server address
	
	.EXAMPLE
		Initiate a Quickscan
		powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file AntiVirusScanEmail.ps1 -QuickScan
		
		Initiate a Fullscan
		powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file AntiVirusScanEmail.ps1 -FullScan
		
		Initiate a Fullscan and send email report. To, From, and SMTP parameters are pre-defined
		powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file AntiVirusScanEmail.ps1 -FullScan -Email
