	.DESCRIPTION
		This script will initiate a full or quick scan, whichever one is uncommented
		out below. It will then write a log to the event viewer logs showing the 
		scan was executed. The final step is to execute a machine policy update so
		the SCCM server is updated on the status of the system.
